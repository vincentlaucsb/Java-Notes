# Java vs. Python/C++

A list some interesting comparisons that popped into my head while coding

## Java vs. Python
### Boolean Shorthands
 * In Python, the boolean value of some_number is True if some_number is any non-zero number.
   * Java: error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to boolean

### Syntax
 * Java has curly braces and semi-colons

### Semantics
 * Dissimilar:
    * Java requires a main() function wrapped in a class and executes it on startup
  * Java requires variable types to be explictly declared

### Constructs
 * Java has do-while and switch statements

### Looping
 * Similar: `break` and `continue` statements
 * Dissimilar:
   * Java has the option of restricting the scope of loop variables to just the loop

### Memory Allocation
 * Both are garbage collected
 
### Object-Oriented Programming
 * Dissimilar:
   * Java has public and private methods
   * Python has consenting adults

## Java vs. C++
### Semantics
 * Both:
   * Every program begins with a call to main()
   * Explicit declaration of variable types
 * Dissimilar: Everything in Java needs to be contained in a class

### Constructs
 * Both have do-while and switch statements

### Pointers
 * Don't exist in Java

### Memory Allocation
* Similar: Dynamic allocation of objects
* Dissimilar:
  * C++ requires manual deallocation of objects
  * Java is garbage collected
